### I am not a good developer 
But I am honest and an **excellent people person and team builder.** I've been development adjascent since 2008 and touched a lot of really interesting companies and projects.

Multi-faceted professional with failures such as:
 - #1 (and only) Salesperson at Fortune featured "Best Place to Work" Startup upon arrival. Drove from Dallas to New York with my then girlfriend and two cats before getting the compensation offer. Negotiated for a more fair salary at one year mark after four quarters of 100%+ quotas on Friday. I was released on Monday, they were appalled by the audacity.
 - Sold and built (**did not ship**) 1st website a college summer when my plan to work at Red Bull Recording Studio in Santa Monica fell through. Still kept the client happy by fixing a bunch of ebay issues and other various web projects.
 - Left an amazing job as the first corporate marketing hire for a $300M/year revenue retailer to be the 5th member of a startup for $1000/Mo and 10%, founded and led by a church minister. He moved back to California wine country in a couple months. I then served time in the print industry. Anyone who has visited a TX warehouse in the summer knows, and even worse, I recruited my friends to join me in that endeavor. Some of them stayed longer than me.
- And somehow, I am now a developer consultant working for a renowned professional services firm helping wherever needed. As much as I have time for academic development work, I spent that time focused on systems. My last presentation

But I will **happily help anyone** getting started or established trying to get their due. Learn from my mistakes and boost your confidence realizing if someone who makes such ridiculous mistakes can do it, there are always ways to win.

- Passionate about high performance computing. AI is cool, but still thinking on materials science, publishing, and advertising (sorry for the ads).
- Will put your app in the cloud and set budget alerts. Maybe will put your app in a really small machine, but not often. 
- DevOps transformation for legacy projects. I might organize meetings, but they will get the hard work done to tear down org barriers. Real roadmap to an always out of reach Utopia.
- Front-end focused, fast framework adopter.
