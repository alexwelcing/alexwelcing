### Your favorite developers' least favorite devops advocate.  
More of a salesy **excellent people person and team builder.** I've been development adjacent since 2008 with weird work experience at exciting organizations.

Multi-faceted professional with failures such as:
 - #1 Salesperson @ magazine cover worthy "Best Place to Work" Startup. Turned cold calls into new contracts with some of the largest publishers in the world. AI + publishing. Absolutely worthless!
 - Sold and built (**did not ship**) 1st website after failing to land a recording studio internship. Instead, sold inventory on eBay where buyers already existed.
 - Left the *dream* job as the first corporate marketing hire for a $300M/year revenue retailer to be the 5th member of a startup for $1000/Mo and 10%. The role latest all of 3 months! 

Now in a consulting developer role. I've transitioned from a client facing communicator and project manager of development to 100% internal focus on site development for leadership reporting and firm communication. Legacy migration and new technology adoption.

When I have time for think work, I am devoted to systems, both code and behavior. Always learning, I'm adopting Rust in 2020 to join the happy and diverse community of crustaceans. My last presentation was at Google Cloud Next in 2018 discussing practical and ethical challenges for NLP in Healthcare and Legal contexts. 

Will **happily help anyone** getting started or established. Learn from my mistakes, access my network, portfolio/CV review, foot in the door tips, etc. I've got hours set aside for this! Electronic mail me here ->>> *aw then the at sign followed by atrispina dot com*

- Passionate about high performance computing. AI sure, but look at frontiers with intersections to unlock like materials science, web publishing, and games.
- Will put your app in the cloud and set budget alerts. 
- DevOps transformation for legacy projects.
- Real roadmaps to an always out of reach Utopia. Probably won't make it on the blockchain.
- Front-end focused, fast framework adopter. JAMstack is not the future, it is the now.
