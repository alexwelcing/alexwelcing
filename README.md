### I am not a good developer 
But I am honest and an **excellent people person and team builder.** I've been development adjascent since 2008. 

Career strategist with hits such as:
 - Sold and built (**did not ship**) 1st website after applying to exactly one internship working at a Recording Studio across the country with Red Bull. 
 - Left an amazing job as an in-house marketing lead to be the 5th member of a startup for $1000/Mo and 10%, funded entirely by a church minister.
 - Moved to NYC from Ft. Worth without a signed job offer, and got hardballed into an awful deal. Negotiated for a more fair salary after one year on a Friday and was released on    Monday. 

But I will **happily help anyone** getting started or established trying to get their due. Learn from my mistakes and boost your confidence realizing if someone who makes such ridiculous mistakes can do it, there are always ways to win.

- Passionate about high performance computing. AI is cool, but still thinking on materials science, publishing, and advertising (sorry for the ads).
- Will put your app in the cloud and set budget alerts. Maybe will put your app in a really small machine, but not often. 
- DevOps transformation for legacy projects. I might organize meetings, but they will get the hard work done to tear down org barriers. Real roadmap to an always out of reach Utopia.
- Front-end focused, fast framework adopter.
- Currently learning Sharepoint because I have rent to pay and am grateful for a job, but, if you are working on something amazing, have law firm money.
