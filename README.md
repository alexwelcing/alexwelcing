### Your favorite developers' least favorite devops advocate.  
More of a salesy **excellent people person and team builder.** I've been development adjacent since 2008 with weird work experience at exciting organizations.

Multi-faceted professional with failures such as:
 - #1 Salesperson @ magazine cover worthy "Best Place to Work" Startup. Turned cold calls into new contracts with some of the largest publishers in the world. AI + publishing!
 - Sold and built (**did not ship**) 1st website after failing to land a recording studio internship a long time ago!
 - Left the *dream* job as the first corporate marketing hire for a $300M/year revenue retailer to be the 5th member of a startup for $1000/Mo and 10%. The role latest all of 3 months! 

And somehow, I am now in a consulting developer role. In the latest role, I've transitioned from a client facing communicator and project manager of development to 100% internal focus on site development for leadership reporting and firm communication. 

When I have time for academic development work latest focus is on systems. Starting Rust in 2020 to join the happy and diverse community of developers singing the praises of a language with great documentation and a fun building experience. Going through the Rustlings series.

My last presentation was at Google Cloud Next in 2018 discussing practical and ethical challenges for NLP in Healthcare and Legal contexts. Amazing teams involved in the development there! I don't even navigate the CLI successfully in the demo!

Will **happily help anyone** getting started or established. Learn from my mistakes, access my network, portfolio/CV review, foot in the door tips, etc. I've got hours set aside for this! Electronic mail me here ->>> *aw then the at sign followed by atrispina dot com*

- Passionate about high performance computing. AI sure, but look at frontiers to unlock such as materials science, web publishing, and games.
- Will put your app in the cloud and set budget alerts. Maybe will put your app in a really small machine if it is happy there. 
- DevOps transformation for legacy projects. Can organize meetings, but we have to work during those meetings and will absolutely rearrange barriers. 
- Real roadmaps to an always out of reach Utopia. Probably won't make it on the blockchain.
- Front-end focused, fast framework adopter. JAMstack is not the future, it is the now.
- Google Cloud Platform user. We exist, and we are not damaged or hostaged! But their collapse on the ethics of AI research makes me now feel sad about this.
- Still use Azure for most work projects.
