### Not a great developer or operator.  
More of a salesy **excellent people person and team builder.** I've been development adjacent since 2008 with weird work experience at exciting organizations.

Multi-faceted professional with failures such as:
 - #1 Salesperson @ magazine cover worthy "Best Place to Work" Startup. Turned cold calls into new contracts with some of the largest publishers in the world. AI + publishing!
 - Sold and built (**did not ship**) 1st website after failing to land a recording studio internship a long time ago!
 - Left the *dream* job as the first corporate marketing hire for a $300M/year revenue retailer to be the 5th member of a startup for $1000/Mo and 10%, founded and led by a church minister. He moved back to California wine country two months after I joined. 
- And somehow, I am now a developer consultant working for a professional services firm helping wherever needed. As much as I have time for academic development work, I spend that time focused on systems. My last presentation was at Google Cloud Next in 2018 discussing practical challenges and considerations for NLP in Healthcare and Legal contexts.

Will **happily help anyone** getting started or established. Learn from my mistakes, access my network, get a portfolio/CV review, getting in the door tips, etc. I've got hours set aside for this! Electronic mail me here ->>> *aw no space then the at sign followed by atrispina dot com*

- Passionate about high performance computing. AI sure, but thinking on the next frontier unlocked for materials science, web publishing, and games lately.
- Will put your app in the cloud and set budget alerts. Maybe will put your app in a really small machine if it is happy there. 
- DevOps transformation for legacy projects. Can organize meetings, but we have to work during those meetings and will absolutely rearrange barriers. 
- Real roadmaps to an always out of reach Utopia.
- Front-end focused, fast framework adopter.
