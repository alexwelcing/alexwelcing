### Not a great developer or operator.  
More of a salesy **excellent people person and team builder.** I've been development adjacent since 2008 with weird work experience at exciting organizations.

Multi-faceted professional with failures such as:
 - #1 Salesperson @ magazine cover worthy "Best Place to Work" Startup. Turned cold calls into new contracts with some of the largest publishers in the world. AI + publishing!
 - Sold and built (**did not ship**) 1st website after failing to land a recording studio internship a long time ago!
 - Left the *dream* job as the first corporate marketing hire for a $300M/year revenue retailer to be the 5th member of a startup for $1000/Mo and 10%, founded and led by a church minister. He moved back to California wine country two months after I joined. 
- And somehow, I am now a developer consultant working for a professional services firm helping wherever needed. As much as I have time for academic development work, I spend that time focused on systems. My last presentation

Will **happily help anyone** getting started or established trying to get their due. Learn from my mistakes and boost your confidence realizing if someone who makes such ridiculous mistakes can do it, there are ways to win.

- Passionate about high performance computing. AI is cool, but still thinking on materials science, publishing, and advertising (sorry for the ads).
- Will put your app in the cloud and set budget alerts. Maybe will put your app in a really small machine. 
- DevOps transformation for legacy projects. Can organize meetings, but focused on the hard work done to tear down org barriers. Real roadmaps to an always out of reach Utopia.
- Front-end focused, fast framework adopter.
